Module 7 - Homework 5 - The Document Object Model


##Issues
I had plenty of issues with this assignment. Some of my problems came in adding '' marks to appended variables (turning them into strings to display). I also had some simple mistakes that were small, but code-breaking.

##Resources
I did not use any resources other than the lecture notes to complete this assignment.
